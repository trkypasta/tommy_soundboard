# tommy_soundboard
A funny little program to play the sounds of a funny little man named Tommy Wiseau. Written to utilize Raspberry Pi's GPIO functionality with push-button inputs.
Image (soundboard_setup.jpg) shows how circuitry for the push-button soundboard is set up on a breadboard. All resistors are 10K.
Sound files were pulled from the incredibly useful site http://theroomsoundboard.com/
